/*
 * This CSS changes the colors of TotalFark headlines. Normally
 * they are black, red, or green -- depending on the state of
 * admin approval. Colorblind users may be unable to tell the
 * difference between red and green, and/or red and black.
 *
 * The colors here shift red towards orange, and green towards
 * blue. The luminosity of the green is also increased, to help
 * it stand out from the darker red/black.
